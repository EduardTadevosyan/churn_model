# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning in Python

This project demonstrates a machine learning solution to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

The deployed Streamlit app allows users to input customer data and receive a prediction on whether the customer will churn — along with the probability of that outcome.
