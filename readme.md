# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning in Python

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By identifying customers likely to leave, the model helps businesses take proactive steps to improve customer retention.

Below you can find the deployed app, which predicts whether a customer will churn and shows the likelihood of that churn.

🖥️ **Live App**: [Streamlit App](https://eduardtadevosyan-churn-model-app-iywd2d.streamlit.app/)  
📊 **Dataset**: [Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
